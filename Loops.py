# Demonstrate about loops and its syntax

# Below loop will print the output from 0 to 9
# by default increment value is 1
print("--------------------")
for x in range(0,10):
    print(x)
print("--------------------")
    
# below is the example for for loop with one parameter
for x in range(5): # 5 is target number, it start from 0 and increase by 1
    print(x)
print("--------------------")

# If you want add increment operator by 2/3/4....
# Below loop will increase the number by 3 as i mentioned 3 as third parameter
for x in range(0,10,3): # 0 is the start, 10 is the target, and 3 is increment 
    print(x)
print("--------------------")
